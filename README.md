# PHP CRUD App
## A simple proof of concept

## Some considerations
+ This is my first time building something with PHP that doesn't involve WordPress.
+ This was also, my first time using MySQL.
+ Due to time restraints, a procedural approach was taken, hence no OOP focus.
+ Initially, I intended to build it using Laravel, but instructions were unclear so Vanilla PHP was the way.
+ The web app is in Spanish.
